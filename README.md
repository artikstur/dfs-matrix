# Deep-First Search algorithm 

## Description:

1. **nxn Matrix**: Each cell of the matrix becomes a node of the graph.

2. **Connecting Vertices**: Each vertex of the graph is connected to neighboring vertices using a specific algorithm.

3. **Traversal Algorithm**: A graph traversal algorithm is applied to search for specific paths or simply to traverse all vertices.

4. **Console Visualization**: The result of graph traversal is visualized in the console for a clear representation of the graph's structure.
